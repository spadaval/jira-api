## create_filter_post

> crate::models::Filter create_filter_post(filter, expand)
Create filter

Creates a filter. The filter is shared according to the [default share scope](#api-rest-api-3-filter-post). The filter is not selected as a favorite.  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.

Expand options include:   *  `sharedUsers` Returns the users that the filter is shared with. This includes users that can browse projects that the filter is shared with. If you don't specify `sharedUsers`, then the `sharedUsers` object is returned but it doesn't list any users. The list of users returned is limited to 1000, to access additional users append `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request.
