## add_attachment_post

> Vec<crate::models::Attachment> add_attachment_post(issue_id_or_key)
Add attachment

Adds one or more attachments to an issue. Attachments are posted as multipart/form-data ([RFC 1867](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt)).  Note that:   *  The request must have a `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` header, if not it is blocked. See [Special headers](#special-request-headers) for more information.  *  The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains the attachments must be `file`.  The following example uploads a file called *myfile.txt* to the issue *TEST-123*:  `curl -D- -u admin:admin -X POST -H \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -F \"file=@myfile.txt\" https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/TEST-123/attachments`  Tip: Use a client library. Many client libraries have classes for handling multipart POST operations. For example, in Java, the Apache HTTP Components library provides a [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html) class for multipart POST operations.  This operation can be accessed anonymously.  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**    *  *Browse Projects* and *Create attachments* [ project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

## expand_attachment_for_humans_get

> crate::models::AttachmentArchiveMetadataReadable expand_attachment_for_humans_get(id)
Get all metadata for an expanded attachment

Returns the metadata for the contents of an attachment, if it is an archive, and metadata for the attachment itself. For example, if the attachment is a ZIP archive, then information about the files in the archive is returned and metadata for the ZIP archive. Currently, only the ZIP archive format is supported.  Use this operation to retrieve data that is presented to the user, as this operation returns the metadata for the attachment itself, such as the attachment's ID and name. Otherwise, use [ Get contents metadata for an expanded attachment](#api-rest-api-3-attachment-id-expand-raw-get), which only returns the metadata for the attachment's contents.  This operation can be accessed anonymously.  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** For the issue containing the attachment:   *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

## expand_attachment_for_machines_get

> crate::models::AttachmentArchiveImpl expand_attachment_for_machines_get(id)
Get contents metadata for an expanded attachment

Returns the metadata for the contents of an attachment, if it is an archive. For example, if the attachment is a ZIP archive, then information about the files in the archive is returned. Currently, only the ZIP archive format is supported.  Use this operation if you are processing the data without presenting it to the user, as this operation only returns the metadata for the contents of the attachment. Otherwise, to retrieve data to present to the user, use [ Get all metadata for an expanded attachment](#api-rest-api-3-attachment-id-expand-human-get) which also returns the metadata for the attachment itself, such as the attachment's ID and name.  This operation can be accessed anonymously.  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** For the issue containing the attachment:   *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
